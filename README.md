Pestpridict: AI for Early Pest Infestation Detection


PestPredict is a machine learning-based system designed to classify different types of pests using image recognition. The model helps in early identification of pests, enabling farmers to take preventive measures before infestations spread. This project serves as a foundation for future enhancements, such as integrating environmental data and real-time monitoring for pest outbreak predictions.
